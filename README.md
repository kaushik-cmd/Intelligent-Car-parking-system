Smart Car Parking System (Age 13–14)
At the age of 13, I designed and built an IoT-based Smart Car Parking System that could be remotely controlled through a mobile app I developed myself. The system allowed precise movement and parking in tight spaces, using ultrasonic sensors and motor control logic.
 To make it more secure, I added PIN-based wireless pairing, ensuring safe communication between the car and app. The project earned 1st place at the District Science Fair Held at SRM AP, marking the start of my journey into practical engineering and embedded systems.
 Key Technologies: Arduino Uno, L298N motor driver, ultrasonic sensors, Bluetooth (HC-05), MIT App Inventor, Embedded C++.
